# Building C/C++ projects that use Fortran libraries

This recipe is complementary to the [Recipe 1](../recipe-01). We will show how a C/C++ project
can use Fortran libraries with CMake taking care of name mangling and compiler ABI compatibility.
This will be achieved using the [`FortranCInterface`] standard CMake module.
