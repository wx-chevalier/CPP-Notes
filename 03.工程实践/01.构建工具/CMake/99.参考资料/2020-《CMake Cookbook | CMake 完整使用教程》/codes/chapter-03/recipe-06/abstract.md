We will show how to detect support for MPI distributed-memory parallelism
standard. Usage of CMake [`IMPORTED` libraries](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-buildsystem.7.html#imported-targets) is shown.
Examples are given for both C++ and C using CMake 3.9 or higher.
The `c-example-3.5` show how to attain the same goal with a lower version of
CMake.
