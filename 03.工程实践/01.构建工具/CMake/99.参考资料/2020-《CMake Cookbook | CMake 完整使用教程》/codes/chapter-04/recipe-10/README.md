# Using test fixtures

In this recipe we demonstrate how to employ test fixtures. These are useful for
more sophisticated tests that require setup actions before the test is run, and
cleanup actions after it has completed (such as creating an example database,
setting up a connection, disconnecting, cleaning up the test database, and so
on).

This recipe is inspired by the [blog post by Craig
Scott](https://crascit.com/2016/10/18/test-fixtures-with-cmake-ctest/).
