# Distributing a C++/Python project built with CMake/pybind11 via PyPI

We discuss how to package a Python project with compiled portions written in C++
for distribution on the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/) (PyPI)
We use [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) to create the C++/Python bindings.
