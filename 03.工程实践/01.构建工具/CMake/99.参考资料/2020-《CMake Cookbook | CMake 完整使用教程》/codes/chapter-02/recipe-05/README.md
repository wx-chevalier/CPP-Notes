# Discovering the host processor instruction set

In this recipe, we discuss how to discover the host processor instruction set
with the help of CMake. The detected [host system information](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/cmake_host_system_information.html) can be used to
either set corresponding compiler flags or to implement optional compilation of
sources or source code generation depending on the host system.
