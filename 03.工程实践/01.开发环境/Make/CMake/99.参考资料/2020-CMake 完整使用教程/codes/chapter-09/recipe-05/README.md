# Building C++ and Python projects using pybind11

This recipe is yet another alternative example of extending Python with C++.
This time we will leverage the [pybind11] project, which requires C++11, at

Our example will retrieve [pybind11] using [`FetchContent`]

[pybind11]: https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
[`FetchContent`]: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html
