[Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org) can parse reStructuredText, Markdown
plain-text files, and generate HTML, ePUB, or PDF documentation. Coupled with the
online [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org) service, it offers a great way to quickly
get started with writing and deploying documentation. This recipe shows how to
use CMake to build documentation based on Sphinx.
