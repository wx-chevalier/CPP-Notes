[Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl) is a popular source code documentation tool in
the C++ community. Running Doxygen will extract comments which contain
documentation tags and create the documentation in a format defined in the
Doxyfile configuration file (HTML, XML, and even LaTeX or PDF). This recipe
shows how to use CMake to build your Doxygen documentation.
