# Managing dependencies with a superbuild: I. The Boost libraries

This recipe shows how to leverage the superbuild pattern to ship your code with
the confidence that a missing dependency will not stop the configuration.  We
will reuse the code example from [Recipe 8 in Chapter
3](../../chapter-03/recipe-08), but reorganize it in the form of a superbuild.
