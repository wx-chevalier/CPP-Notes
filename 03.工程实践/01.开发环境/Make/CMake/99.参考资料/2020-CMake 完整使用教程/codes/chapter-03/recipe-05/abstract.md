We will show how to detect support for the OpenMP shared-memory parallelism
standard. Usage of CMake [`IMPORTED` libraries](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-buildsystem.7.html#imported-targets) is shown. Examples are given for
both C++ and Fortran using CMake 3.9 or higher. The `cxx-example-3.5` and
`fortran-example-3.5` show how to attain the same goal with a lower version of
CMake.
