# Overview
## Templates
A vector is a general concept, it's unlikely a user will always want a vector of
doubles, and so the container should be independent of its type. A template is
a class or a function that we parameterize with a set of types or values.
- We use templates to represent ideas that are best understood as something
general. From which we can generate specific types and functions by specifying
arguments such as vector's element type.
