# Overview

## Modularity

C++ programs consist of separately developed parts,
such as functions, user-defined types, class
hierarchies, and templates.

- It's important to distinguish between the interface
  and implementation when managing these parts. At the
  language level, C++ represents interfaces by
  declarations. Declarations specify all that's needed
  to use a function or a type.
- Elsewhere are the function definitions; the function
  body; the implementation.
