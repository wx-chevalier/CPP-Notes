# Overview

## The Basics

This chapter presents the notation of C++, C++'s
model of memory and computation, and basic mechanisms
for organizing code into a program.

- These language facilities support styles most often
  seen in C and sometimes called _procedural programming._

## Programs

**C++ is a compiled language**. Source text is processed by
the compiler, producing object files. These are combined
by the linker yielding an executable program.

- A C++ program can consists of multiple source files.
- C++ executables are not portable but the source code
  is. An executable can be created for a specific platform
  from the original source code.

The ISO C++ standard; technical document for people
writing C++ compilers and standard library
implementations, defines two kinds of entities:

- _Core language features_ (built-in types)
- _Standard-library components_ (std containers and I/O
  operations)
