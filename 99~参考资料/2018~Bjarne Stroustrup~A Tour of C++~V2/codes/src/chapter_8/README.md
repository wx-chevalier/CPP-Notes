# Overview
## Library Overview
No significant program is written without a set of libraries. Most can be
tedious to write in the bare language, whereas any task can be rendered
simple with the introduction of a library.

Chapter 9-15 give a quick your of key standard-library facilities. Some
useful standard-library types included:
- `string`
- `ostream`
- `variant`
- `vector`
- `map`
- `path`
- `unique_ptr`
- `thread`
- `regex`
- `complex`

## Overall Goal
Don't be discouraged or distracted by an incomplete understanding of details.
The specification of the standard library is over two-thirds of the ISO C++
standard. Explore it, and prefer it to homemade alternatives. Systems and
libraries that deal with features that extend past C++ facilities are not
covered here.
