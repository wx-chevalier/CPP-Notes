## An Overview
This repository covers the contents of Bjarne Stroustrup's
book, A Tour of C++. Due to the rockiness
of `C++20` support, the repository will follow the second
edition of the book. There might be some examples
involving `C++20` features, but for the most part `C++17`
will be the main focus.

## Purpose
To review C++ fundamentals and explore `C++17` features.
> Like other modern languages, C++ is large and there 
are a large number of libraries needed for effective use.
This thin book aims to give an experienced programmer an
idea of what constitutes modern C++. It covers most major
language features and the major standard-library
components. This book can be read in just a few hours 
but, obviously, there is much more to writing good C++
than can be learned in a day. *- Bjarne Stroustrup*
