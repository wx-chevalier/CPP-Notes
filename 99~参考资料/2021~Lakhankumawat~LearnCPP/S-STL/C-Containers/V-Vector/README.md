- Vectors are same as dynamic arrays with the ability to resize itself automatically when an element is inserted or deleted, with their storage being handled automatically by the container. 
- Vector elements are placed in contiguous storage so that they can be accessed and traversed using iterators. 
- In vectors, data is inserted at the end. 
- Inserting at the end takes differential time, as sometimes there may be a need of extending the array. 
- Removing the last element takes only constant time because no resizing happens. 
- Inserting and erasing at the beginning or in the middle is linear in time.
